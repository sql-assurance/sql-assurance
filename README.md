SQLAssurance (Under heavy development)
===============================

SQLAssurance is a programmer oriented SQL Testing framework. A full name for this kind of testing could be: Scheduled SQL Testing.

This testing framework is able to work in a two different modes:

1. You can execute the sql-assurance script **like any other testing framework**, you will have as a result something like the image below this text:

2. You can **schedule your tests individually**, for instance, you want to execute specific query every night at 2am. This can be useful to track if your query and your data are behaving as expected.
